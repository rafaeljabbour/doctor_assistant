**An AI-Powered, Autonomous Robot to Streamline Pre-Screening in Medical Waiting Rooms**

Senioritis is a proof-of-concept robot designed to reduce operational inefficiencies in walk-in clinic waiting rooms. With AI-driven conversations, autonomous navigation, and real-time database updates, Senioritis aims to minimize patient wait times, reduce staff workload, and improve overall patient satisfaction.

## Introduction
Senioritis was built during **UTRA Hacks 2025**, hosted by the University of Toronto Robotics Association, where it won **Best Use of MongoDB**. The project addresses the long-standing problem of patient wait times and inefficient patient screening in medical clinics. By automating the pre-screening process, Senioritis helps clinic staff allocate their time more effectively and offers patients a more engaging and less stressful waiting experience.

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Robot Navigation:** An ESP32-driven chassis that can move to any assigned seat in the waiting room.
- **Queue-Based Patient Prioritization:** Ensures a fair “first-in-first-out” approach to patient visits.
- **AI-Driven Conversations:** Powered by OpenAI APIs for speech-to-text, text-to-speech, and symptom extraction.
- **Real-Time Database Updates:** Uses MongoDB Atlas to store and retrieve patient data, seating assignments, and user logins in real time.
- **Admin Dashboard:** A React-based web application for staff to manage patient seating, monitor active patients, and review past visit information.

## Research & Motivation
Medical waiting rooms often suffer from long wait times and inefficient pre-screening, leading to:
- Patient dissatisfaction & stress
- Delayed care & worse health outcomes
- Economic inefficiencies for healthcare providers

**Supporting Literature:**
- **Bleustein et al. (2014):** Demonstrated the direct correlation between wait times and patient dissatisfaction (*The American Journal of Managed Care*).
- **Pines et al. (2011):** Highlighted the global issue of emergency department crowding and its impact on wait times (*Academic Emergency Medicine*).
- **Collins (2020):** Discussed the use of robots in hospitals to minimize human contact and reduce virus transmission risks (COVID-19 related).
- **Hollander & Carr (2020):** Showed how telemedicine and AI chatbots can reduce wait times and bottlenecks (Telemedicine and AI adoption during the pandemic).

## System Architecture

### Hardware
- **ESP32**
  - Handles WiFi connectivity and HTTP requests.
  - Controls two motors for autonomous navigation.
- **Motor Driver & Chassis**
  - Enables precise movement from one coordinate (a, b) to another (c, d).
  - The system updates its position after each successful movement.
- **(Future Upgrade) Microphone & Speaker**
  - Will replace the current phone-based audio system.
  - **Adafruit I2S MEMS Microphone Breakout 3421** for audio input.
  - **PSR-28N08A-JQ** for audio output.

### Software
- **React Admin Dashboard**
  - Allows clinic staff to manage seating arrangements in real time.
  - Stores new and past patient data in MongoDB.
  - Provides quick retrieval of patient history.
- **MongoDB Atlas**
  - Central storage for patient data, seat assignments, and login credentials.
  - Stores each patient’s historical visits indefinitely.
- **Flask Server**
  - Hosts AI modules and connects to OpenAI APIs.
  - Provides a simple front-end for text generation, text-to-speech, speech recognition, and symptom extraction.
- **ESP32 HTTP Endpoints**
  - **GET** requests to retrieve seat assignments and patient queue order.
  - **POST** requests to update symptom data in real time.

### AI Integration
- **Text-to-Speech & Speech-to-Text:** Converts spoken input from patients into text, and synthesizes spoken responses from the AI.
- **Continuous Conversations:** Maintains a conversation history with GPT to provide context-aware follow-up questions and more personalized patient interactions.
- **Symptom Extraction:** Parses transcripts for medical symptoms, building a comprehensive overview of the patient’s condition.

### Communication
- **WiFi Connectivity:** The ESP32 securely connects to clinic WiFi.
- **HTTP Requests:** Retrieves seating info from MongoDB and updates patient symptom details.
- **Real-Time Updates:** Ensures the staff dashboard and robot are always in sync with current patient statuses.

### Database Structure
Senioritis uses MongoDB Atlas with the following collections:
- **patients**
  - Contains patient details, seat number, entry time, and past visit history.
  - Updated in real time when a patient arrives, moves, or completes screening.
- **logins**
  - Stores user credentials for doctors, nurses, and secretaries.
- **robotCoordinates** (or integrated into patients documents)
  - Tracks each patient’s seat location and entry time for the robot’s queue-based navigation.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Senioritis.git
cd Senioritis

### Install Dependencies

**Frontend (React Dashboard):**
```bash
cd client
npm install
```

**Backend (Flask Server):**
```bash
cd server
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**ESP32 Firmware:**
- Use the Arduino IDE or PlatformIO to flash the ESP32 code.
- Update the WiFi credentials and server endpoint in the firmware.

### Set Up MongoDB
- Create a MongoDB Atlas cluster and obtain the connection URI.
- Update the `.env` or configuration file with your MongoDB connection string.

### Run the Project

**React App:**
```bash
cd client
npm start
```

**Flask Server:**
```bash
cd server
python app.py
```

**ESP32:**
- Flash the firmware to your ESP32 and ensure it’s connected to the same network.

## Usage & Workflow

1. **Staff Checks In Patients**
   - Assigns each patient a seat from the React Admin Dashboard.
   - The new seating information is instantly stored in MongoDB.

2. **Robot Retrieves Queue Info**
   - Makes a GET request to fetch seat coordinates and patient entry times.
   - Prioritizes patients based on arrival time (FIFO).

3. **Autonomous Navigation**
   - The ESP32 calculates the path from its current location to the patient’s seat.
   - Moves the robot there using its motor control logic.

4. **AI-Powered Conversation**
   - Once the robot arrives, it uses AI to conduct a pre-screening conversation.
   - Speech recognition and text-to-speech facilitate natural interaction.

5. **Real-Time Symptom Updates**
   - The robot (via ESP32) posts the extracted symptom data to MongoDB.
   - Staff can see updated patient info in the dashboard immediately.

6. **Repeat for All Patients**
   - The robot cycles through the queue, ensuring each patient gets screened in order.

## Future Enhancements
- **Dedicated Microphone & Speaker**
  - Integrate I2S microphone and speakers to eliminate the need for phone-based audio I/O.
- **Multiple Robots**
  - Scale the solution for larger clinics with multiple robots working in tandem.
  - Implement more advanced path-planning and collision avoidance.
- **Advanced Analytics**
  - Track wait times, patient flow, and staff workload for data-driven improvements.
- **Enhanced AI & Symptom Detection**
  - Integrate medical knowledge bases to provide more accurate triage and recommendations.
